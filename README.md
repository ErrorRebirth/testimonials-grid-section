## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how css gird works. CSS Grid is a powerful tool for creating flexible and responsive layouts, and is well-suited for tasks such as creating multi-column layouts, creating grids of items with varying sizes, and aligning elements on a webpage. It is supported by all modern browsers, and is a good alternative to using older layout techniques such as floats and tables.

### Continued development

I want to continue this development in the future using the sass.
